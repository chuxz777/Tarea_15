    Dollar Tree

    As Dollar Tree local search listings – including name, address and phone (NAP) information - needed increased monitoring and management and higher find-ability in search results, Localeze was asked to improve the retailer's presence across online platforms including search engines, directories and mobile and social sites.

    With Localeze as a partner, we can quickly update Dollar Tree's ever-growing population of stores in an efficient and accurate manner. This makes it possible for shoppers to easily find our stores and take advantage of our mission to provide great products for $1 or less.
